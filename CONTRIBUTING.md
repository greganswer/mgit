## Contributing

We want to start off by saying thank you for using and contributing to this project.
This project is a labor of love, and we appreciate all of the users that catch bugs,
make performance improvements, and help with documentation. Every contribution is meaningful,
so thank you for participating. That being said, here are a few guidelines that we ask you to
follow so we can successfully address your issue.

### Submitting Issues

Please include the following:

* Project version/tag/commit hash you are using
* Python version you're using
* The Operating System
* A stacktrace or log output if available

Describe your issue and give as much steps as necessary to reproduce
it.  If possible add what you expected to happen and what actually
happened to get a better understanding of the problem.

### Submitting A Pull Request

If you want to submit a pull request make sure your code is cleaned up and no
artifacts are left behind. Please check the Checklist on the Pull Request
template to ensure that you've done everything correctly. Make sure your commits
are clearly structured and follow _the seven rules of a great commit message_:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
