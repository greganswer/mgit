## Development

### Virtual environment setup

Make sure you have [Python 3.7.4](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed.

There are 2 ways to set this up for development: standard vs. `virtualenvwrapper`.
The `virtualenvwrapper` package requires a one time setup per machine but it's a bit
easier to use day-to-day.

#### standard

```bash
# Install packages locally
pip3 install --editable .

# Install **virtualenv** using pip3
pip3 install virtualenv

# Create a virtual environment. **NOTE:** You can use any name instead of **venv**.
python3 -m venv env

# Activate your virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate
```

If you need to deactivate:

    deactivate

#### virtualenvwrapper

If you prefer to use `virtualenvwrapper` do the following:

1. Install **virtualenvwrapper** using pip3

        pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

1. Add the following to `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`:

        export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/code/.virtualenvs
        export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/code
        export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python
        export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=/usr/local/bin/virtualenv
        export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV_ARGS='--no-site-packages'
        source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

1. Update the current shell with `source ~/.bash_profile` or `source ~/.zshrc`
1. Make the virtual environment

        mkvirtualenv mgit

1. Enter the project environment

        workon mgit
